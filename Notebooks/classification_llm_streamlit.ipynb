(Photo courtesy of Mary Ann \\nHansen, Virginia Polytechnic Institute a nd State University)   \\n  \\n \\nBacterial Spot of Tomato  \\nMichelle Marks *, UW -Madison  Plant Pathology  \\n \\nWhat is bacterial  spot ?  Bacterial spot of tomato is a potentially devastating \\ndisease that, in severe cases, can lead to unmarketable  fruit and even plant death.  \\nBacterial sp ot can occur wherever tomatoes are grown, but is found most frequently \\nin warm , wet climates, as well as in \\ngreenhouses.  The disease  is often  an \\nissue in Wisconsin.  \\n \\nWhat does bacterial  spot look \\nlike?  Bacterial spot  can affect all above \\nground parts of a tomato plant , including \\nthe leaves, stem s, and fruit .  Bacterial \\nspot appears on leaves as smal l (less \\nthan ⅛ inch), some times water -soaked \\n(i.e., wet -looking ) circular areas .  Spots \\nmay initially be yellow -green , but darken \\nto brownish -red as they age .  When the \\ndisease is severe, e xtensive leaf \\nyellowing and leaf loss  can also occur .  \\nOn green fruit, spots  are typically small, \\nraised and blister -like, and may have a \\nyellowish halo.  As fruit  mature, the spots  \\nenlarge ( reaching a maximum size of ¼ \\ninch) and turn brown , scabby  and rough.  \\nMature spots may be raised , or sunken with raised edges.  Bacterial spot symptoms \\ncan be easily confused with symptoms of another tomato disease called bacterial \\nspeck .  For more inform ation on this disease , see Universit y of Wisconsin  Garden \\nFacts X HT1250 .  \\n \\nWhere does bacterial spot  come from?  Bacterial spot of tomato is caused \\nby Xanthomonas  vesicatoria , Xanthomonas  euvesicatoria , Xanthomonas  gardneri , \\nand Xanthomonas  perforans .  These bacteria l pathogens  can be introd uced into a \\ngarden on contaminated seed and transplants , which  may or may not show \\nsymptoms .  The pathogens  enter  plant s through natural openings (e.g., stomates) , \\nas well as through wounds.  Disease development is favored by warm (75 ° to 86°F), \\nwet weathe r.  Wind -driven  rain can contribute  to more severe disease as the \\npathogens are splashed and spread to healthy leaves and fruit .  Bacterial spot \\npathogens  can survive  well in tomato debris,  but they survive very poorly in soil  \\nwhen not associated with debris.   \\n \\nHow do I save plants with bacterial spot?  A plant with bacterial spot \\ncannot be cured.   Remove s ymptomatic plants  from your garden  or greenhouse to \\nprevent the spread of bacteria  to healthy plants.   Burn , bury or hot compost the \\naffected plants  and DO NOT  eat symptomatic  fruit.  Although bacterial spot  \\n  \\nUniversity of Wisconsin Garden Facts  Provided to you by:  XHT1244  \\nRevised  \\nFeb. 20, 201 7' metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Marvin\\\\Documents\\\\WBS\\\\Final_Project\\\\Data\\\\llm_train\\\\bacterial_spots_only\\\\Bacterial_Spot_of_Tomato.pdf', 'page': 0}\n"

      "1.1 Assessing Your Space and Environment\n",
      "Assessing the space and environment for houseplants is essential to ensure their optimal growth\n",
      "and health. Different plants have varying requirements for light, temperature, humidity, and \n",
      "space. By considering these factors, you can choose the right plants and create a suitable \n",
      "environment for them. Here are some key points to assess when setting up space for \n",
      "houseplants:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Lighting conditions: The amount and quality of light in a space significantly influences \n",
      "plant growth. Determine the light levels in the area where you plan to place your plants. \n",
      "Some plants prefer bright, direct sunlight, while others thrive in moderate or low light \n",
      "conditions. Consider the orientation of windows, the presence of obstructions, and the \n",
      "duration of direct sunlight in that space.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Temperature: Most houseplants prefer temperatures like those that humans find \n",
      "comfortable—typically between 65°F (18°C) and 75°F (24°C). However, some plants have \n",
      "specific temperature preferences, so it's crucial to choose plants that can tolerate the \n",
      "temperature range of your space. Avoid placing plants in drafty areas, near heating vents,\n",
      "or air conditioning units, as extreme temperature fluctuations can harm them.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Humidity: Indoor environments often have lower humidity levels, especially during winter\n",
      "when heating systems can dry the air. Some plants, such as tropical species, prefer higher\n",
      "humidity levels. Consider using humidifiers or grouping plants together to create a \n",
      "microclimate with increased humidity if necessary.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Air circulation: Adequate air circulation is vital for preventing stagnant air, which can lead \n",
      "to pest problems and fungal issues. Ensure there is some airflow in the room but avoid \n",
      "placing plants directly in drafty areas.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Space availability: Assess the available space and the size of the plants you want to grow. \n",
      "Consider the growth habit of the plant, both above and below the soil. Some plants \n",
      "require ample room to spread out, while others are more compact. Consider the mature \n",
      "size of the plant and ensure there is enough space for it to grow without being cramped.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "Accessibility: Consider the ease of access to the plants for watering, pruning, and \n",
      "maintenance. Placing plants on surfaces that are easily reachable and close to a water \n",
      "source will make caring for them more convenient.\n",
      "7.\n",
      "Potential hazards: Evaluate the area for any potential hazards to your plants. Avoid \n",
      "placing them near radiators, fireplaces, or areas with extreme temperature fluctuations. \n",
      "Keep them away from toxic substances, including certain cleaning agents or household \n",
      "chemicals.\n",
      "8.\n",
      "Environmental factors: Take note of any additional environmental factors that might \n",
      "affect your plants, such as noise, air pollution, or ethylene-producing appliances. Some \n",
      "plants may be sensitive to these factors and may require extra care or protection.\n",
      "Remember to research the specific requirements of the plants you choose to ensure a good \n",
      "match with your space and environment. Taking the time to assess these factors will help you \n",
      "create an optimal environment for your houseplants, promoting their growth, health, and \n",
      "longevity.\n",
      "1.2 Understanding Light Requirements\n",
      "Understanding the light requirements for houseplants is crucial for their overall health and \n",
      "growth. Light is one of the most important factors that influence a plant's ability to carry out \n",
      "photosynthesis, which is essential for energy production. Here are some key points to help you \n",
      "understand the light requirements of houseplants:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Light intensity: Light intensity refers to the brightness or strength of light. Different plants\n",
      "have varying light intensity requirements. Assess the available light in your space and \n",
      "categorize it as bright, moderate, or low light. Bright light is direct sunlight or intense, \n",
      "unobstructed light, whereas moderate light is filtered or indirect sunlight. Low light refers\n",
      "to areas with minimal natural light or those far from windows.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Duration of light: Plants require a certain amount of light each day to carry out \n",
      "photosynthesis effectively. Most houseplants thrive with 10 to 12 hours of light per day. \n",
      "Some plants, such as succulents or cacti, may tolerate shorter periods of light, while \n",
      "others, like tropical foliage plants, may benefit from longer exposure.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Light quality: Light quality refers to the specific wavelengths of light that plants need for \n",
      "photosynthesis. The two primary types of light that affect plant growth are red and blue \n",
      "light. Red light stimulates flowering and fruiting, while blue light promotes leafy growth. \n",
      "Full-spectrum light, which includes both red and blue wavelengths, provides a balanced \n",
      "spectrum that supports overall plant health. Natural sunlight typically offers a full \n",
      "spectrum of light.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Adjusting light levels: If you find that your space doesn't provide adequate light for your \n",
      "plants' needs, you can adjust supplement or modify the light levels. Some options \n",
      "include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Natural light: Place plants near windows that receive suitable light intensity. \n",
      "South-facing windows generally offer the brightest light, while north-facing \n",
      "windows provide lower light levels. East and west-facing windows offer moderate \n",
      "to bright light, depending on the time of day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial lighting: Supplemental artificial lighting, such as fluorescent or LED grow\n",
      "lights, can provide the necessary light spectrum and intensity for plants. Position \n",
      "the lights close enough to the plants to ensure adequate coverage. Keep in mind \n",
      "that different plants may require different light intensities, so adjust the height \n",
      "and duration of artificial lighting accordingly.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Signs of inadequate light: Understanding the signs of inadequate light can help you \n",
      "identify if your plants are not receiving enough light. Some common signs include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Elongated, weak stems: Plants may stretch or grow taller to reach more light, \n",
      "resulting in weak and spindly growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaf discoloration: Leaves may turn pale or yellow, indicating insufficient \n",
      "chlorophyll production.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaf drop: Plants may shed their lower leaves, particularly those located farther \n",
      "from the light source.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reduced flowering or fruiting: Insufficient light can lead to a decrease in flower or\n",
      "fruit production.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stunted growth: Plants may exhibit slow or limited growth overall.\n",
      "By understanding the light requirements of your houseplants, you can ensure they receive the \n",
      "appropriate amount and quality of light to thrive. Remember to consider the specific needs of \n",
      "each plant species and adjust accordingly to create an optimal lighting environment.\n",
      "1.3 Considering Temperature and Humidity\n",
      "Temperature and humidity are important factors to consider when caring for houseplants. \n",
      "Different plants have varying preferences and requirements for temperature and humidity levels.\n",
      "Here are some considerations for temperature and humidity when caring for your houseplants:\n",
      "Temperature:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Optimal temperature range: Most houseplants thrive in temperatures like those that \n",
      "humans find comfortable, typically between 65°F (18°C) and 75°F (24°C). However, \n",
      "specific plants may have different temperature preferences, so it's important to research \n",
      "and understand the temperature range suitable for your plants.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Temperature fluctuations: Avoid placing plants in areas with extreme temperature \n",
      "fluctuations, such as near heating vents, drafty windows, or air conditioning units. Rapid \n",
      "temperature changes can stress plants and affect their growth.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Seasonal adjustments: Recognize that indoor temperatures may fluctuate with the \n",
      "changing seasons. For example, during winter, when heating systems are used, indoor air\n",
      "tends to be drier. You may need to adjust watering and humidity levels to compensate \n",
      "for the lower humidity.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Cold drafts: Avoid placing plants near cold drafts or in areas that experience cold air \n",
      "currents. Cold drafts can damage foliage and reduce the overall health of the plant.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Heat stress: Some plants may be sensitive to high temperatures. If your space tends to \n",

      "important aspects of plant care. \n",
      "Light\n",
      "Perhaps the major environmental factor \n",
      "limiting plant growth indoors is lack of ade­\n",
      "quate light. As natural light enters homes, it \n",
      "decreases very quickly. For example, a plant \n",
      "1 foot away from a window may receive \n",
      "100 foot-candles of light. If it is moved 2 \n",
      "feet away from the window, it will receive \n",
      "only 25 foot-candles of light. At 3 feet it \n",
      "receives only 11 foot-candles, and very few, \n",
      "if any, houseplants do well at such low light \n",
      "intensities.\n",
      "The most expedient method of adjusting \n",
      "light intensity is to move the plant closer \n",
      "to or farther from a light source such as a \n",
      "window. Unfortunately, this may place the \n",
      "plant in an inconvenient spot. \n",
      "To increase light intensity you can:\n",
      "•\t Moving the plant to a lighter room \n",
      "(southern versus northern exposure)\n",
      "•\t Placing the plant near an electric light\n",

      "(Figure 1a). The gravel will evaporate water \n",

      "Water\n",
      "Watering is the most important (and \n",

      "must have a continuous and adequate sup­\n",
      "ply of water, but they can absorb water from \n",
      "the soil only under certain conditions. \n",
      "First, there must be available water in \n",
      "the soil. Soil particles hold some water \n",
      "too firmly for plants to take up. The water \n",
      "available to plants is water in excess of that \n",
      "required to satisfy the soil itself. The quan­\n",
      "tity and type of soil mix will determine how \n",
      "much water the pot retains for plant use.\n",
      "Second, some air must be in the soil for \n",
      "plant roots to function and absorb water. \n",
      "Therefore, the soil must not contain so \n",
      "much water that no room is left for air. A \n",
      "good potting soil will not hold too much \n",
      "water if a hole in the bottom of the con­\n",
      "tainer allows excess water to drain away.\n",
      "The difference between these two \n",
      "extremes (no available water versus satu­\n",
      "rated soil) is called the available water sup­\n",
      "ply. Proper water management avoids both \n",
      "extremes and maintains a supply of avail­\n",
      "able water at all times. \n",
      "The following guidelines may help you \n",
      "establish a satisfactory watering schedule:\n",
      "•\t Use a well-prepared potting soil to assure \n",
      "good water-retention capacity as well as \n",
      "space for air.\n",
      "•\t Make sure containers have at least one \n",
      "drainage hole so excess water can drain \n",
      "away. \n",
      "•\t When watering, apply enough water to \n",
      "run out the drainage hole. This usually \n",
      "assures that you have replenished the \n",
      "available water supply and also reduces \n",
      "salt buildup.\n",
      "•\t Do not let pots sit in excess water. Pour \n",
      "it away or raise pots so they always are \n",
      "above the level of drained-out water in \n",
      "the saucer.\n",
      "•\t Do not water on a time schedule. Allow \n",
      "the soil to become dry on the surface \n",
      "before you water again. This method \n",
      "maintains a good balance of air and \n",
      "water in the soil.\n",
      "•\t If some plants require frequent watering, \n",
      "move them into slightly larger pots (with \n",
      "greater water-holding capacity).\n",
      "•\t Some plants, such as desert cacti and \n",
      "succulents, should be watered only a \n",
      "little, if at all, during the short days of \n",
      "winter. With the exception of seedlings \n",
      "and very young plants, these plants need \n",
      "no water from about mid-November to \n",
      "mid-March. Most cacti and many suc­\n",

      "Aphids are small insects about 1⁄16 to 1⁄8 \n",
      "inch long. They are six-legged, variously \n",
      "colored, and some look powdery or woolly. \n",
      "Both wingless and winged forms can be \n",
      "found on plants. Under the right conditions, \n",
      "aphids multiply rapidly and can spread \n",
      "quickly to other plants in the house. Aphids \n",
      "have sucking mouthparts that pierce plant \n",
      "tissue and suck out juices. Damaged leaves \n",
      "lose their green color and look stunted, \n",
      "distorted, or curled. Heavy infestations may \n",
      "damage or actually kill plants. \n",
      "The excreta (honeydew) given off by \n",
      "aphids is another problem associated with \n",
      "this pest. This material is sticky, gives leaf \n",
      "surfaces a shiny look, and provides food for \n",
      "the development of sooty mold.\n",
      "Whiteflies\n",
      "Whiteflies are tiny insects about 1⁄10 to 1⁄16 \n",
      "inch long that resemble tiny moths. Their \n",
      "bodies and wings are covered with a white, \n",
      "powdery substance. When at rest, they \n",
      "hold their wings rooflike over their bodies. \n",
      "Both the immature stages and adults have \n",
      "sucking mouthparts. There are five distinct \n",
      "stages in the whitefly’s development: \n",
      "1.\t The egg, which is laid on the underside of \n",
      "a leaf and often is covered with a pow­\n",
      "dery material\n",
      "2.\t The newly hatched or “crawler” nymph, \n",
      "which is flat, nearly transparent, and can \n",
      "move\n",
      "3.\t The intermediate nymph, which has no \n",
      "antennae or legs and therefore cannot \n",
      "move\n",
      "4.\t The dark nymphal stage, which is some­\n",

      "5.\t The adult\n",
      "A single female can lay up to 400 eggs, \n",
      "and whiteflies continuously breed in homes \n",

      "resembles aphid damage. In addition, the \n",
      "adults are active fliers and become a house­\n",
      "hold nuisance.\n",
      "Scales\n",
      "Several different scales infest house­\n",
      "plants. The adults generally are quite small, \n",
      "ranging from 1⁄16 to 1⁄8 inch in diameter, and \n",
      "may be white, black, brown, gray, or tan. \n",
      "They attach rigidly to plants. Many scales \n",
      "are shaped somewhat like a ball and have \n",
      "no distinctive features except for being flat \n",
      "or slightly bulging. Some have distinctive \n",
      "shapes, such as oyster shells (that is, oys­\n",
      "tershell scale), while others look like turtle \n",
      "shells. The scale actually is a hard or soft \n",
      "covering that protects the insect. The adult \n",
      "male is the only winged member of the \n",
      "scale group. \n",
      "Damage by scales is similar to that from \n",
      "aphids and whiteflies. Honeydew and sooty \n",
      "mold often are present. Severe plant injury \n",
      "or death may be the final result of poor \n",
      "control.\n",
      "Chemical control of adults often is \n",
      "impossible. The female usually lays eggs \n",
      "under a scale. When eggs hatch, tiny \n",
      "crawlers emerge and begin to move about \n",
      "in search of a place to feed. The crawler \n",
      "stage is the most easily killed with chemical \n",

      "the most serious pests of houseplants. Most \n",
      "appear powdery. They are about 3⁄16 inch \n",
      "long, flat, and slender. Some have waxy \n",
      "filaments extending from their bodies. Most \n",
      "species move freely but slowly on plants. \n",
      "Females are wingless, while males have a \n",
      "single pair of wings. Eggs are laid in clusters \n",
      "and are covered by waxy or fuzzy material. \n",
      "Mealybugs attack all plant parts. \n",
      "Damage is similar to that caused by aphids. \n",
      "Honeydew and sooty mold frequently \n",

      "no wings. They are, in fact, closely related \n",
      "to spiders. Spider mites are extremely small. \n",
      "A hand lens of at least 10X magnification \n",
      "often is needed to see them. \n",
      "Usually, mite damage appears long before \n",
      "the mites themselves are noticed. Plants \n",

      "young stem ends, buds, and flowers. They \n",
      "crawl from plant to plant where leaves \n",
      "touch. They also can be transferred to other \n",
      "plants by hands or clothing. \n",
      "Damage consists of twisted, curled, and \n",
      "brittle leaves, deformed buds, and flowers \n",
      "that often are streaked with darker color. \n",
      "Blackening of leaves also is common.\n",
      "Minor or Less Common Pests\n",
      "Leafminers\n",
      "Many different insects commonly are \n",
      "called leafminers. Members of the fly, \n",
      "sawfly, and moth/butterfly groups are the \n",
      "most common. The larval stage is respon­\n",
      "sible for the leafmining damage, which \n",
      "appears as a winding, discolored trail or an \n",
      "irregular blotch within leaf tissue. Damage \n",
      "from these insects rarely is serious; it usu­\n",
