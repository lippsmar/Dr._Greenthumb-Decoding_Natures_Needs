(Photo courtesy of Mary Ann \\nHansen, Virginia Polytechnic Institute a nd State University)   \\n  \\n \\nBacterial Spot of Tomato  \\nMichelle Marks *, UW -Madison  Plant Pathology  \\n \\nWhat is bacterial  spot ?  Bacterial spot of tomato is a potentially devastating \\ndisease that, in severe cases, can lead to unmarketable  fruit and even plant death.  \\nBacterial sp ot can occur wherever tomatoes are grown, but is found most frequently \\nin warm , wet climates, as well as in \\ngreenhouses.  The disease  is often  an \\nissue in Wisconsin.  \\n \\nWhat does bacterial  spot look \\nlike?  Bacterial spot  can affect all above \\nground parts of a tomato plant , including \\nthe leaves, stem s, and fruit .  Bacterial \\nspot appears on leaves as smal l (less \\nthan ⅛ inch), some times water -soaked \\n(i.e., wet -looking ) circular areas .  Spots \\nmay initially be yellow -green , but darken \\nto brownish -red as they age .  When the \\ndisease is severe, e xtensive leaf \\nyellowing and leaf loss  can also occur .  \\nOn green fruit, spots  are typically small, \\nraised and blister -like, and may have a \\nyellowish halo.  As fruit  mature, the spots  \\nenlarge ( reaching a maximum size of ¼ \\ninch) and turn brown , scabby  and rough.  \\nMature spots may be raised , or sunken with raised edges.  Bacterial spot symptoms \\ncan be easily confused with symptoms of another tomato disease called bacterial \\nspeck .  For more inform ation on this disease , see Universit y of Wisconsin  Garden \\nFacts X HT1250 .  \\n \\nWhere does bacterial spot  come from?  Bacterial spot of tomato is caused \\nby Xanthomonas  vesicatoria , Xanthomonas  euvesicatoria , Xanthomonas  gardneri , \\nand Xanthomonas  perforans .  These bacteria l pathogens  can be introd uced into a \\ngarden on contaminated seed and transplants , which  may or may not show \\nsymptoms .  The pathogens  enter  plant s through natural openings (e.g., stomates) , \\nas well as through wounds.  Disease development is favored by warm (75 ° to 86°F), \\nwet weathe r.  Wind -driven  rain can contribute  to more severe disease as the \\npathogens are splashed and spread to healthy leaves and fruit .  Bacterial spot \\npathogens  can survive  well in tomato debris,  but they survive very poorly in soil  \\nwhen not associated with debris.   \\n \\nHow do I save plants with bacterial spot?  A plant with bacterial spot \\ncannot be cured.   Remove s ymptomatic plants  from your garden  or greenhouse to \\nprevent the spread of bacteria  to healthy plants.   Burn , bury or hot compost the \\naffected plants  and DO NOT  eat symptomatic  fruit.

      "it. But even if your plant can tolerate less frequent watering, try not to go \n",
      "weeks without watering and randomly surprise it with a well-intentioned \n",
      "deluge. When you water, make sure water runs out of the drainage holes so \n",
      "you know it's not only reaching the top part of the plant. \n",

      "Like humans, your plant can get sunburned. Pale or white leaves are usually \n",
      "a result of too much light. Luckily, this is easily resolved by moving your \n",

      "If your plant starts to wilt and you wonder, \"What's wrong with my plant?\" it \n",

      "susceptible to attracting bugs. During Summer months in particular, check your cacti if they are on a windowsill as mealy bugs can\n",

      "watering than moist-soil plants such as African violets \n",
      "and ferns.\n",
      "Proper watering keeps the soil moist enough to supply \n",
      "the plants’ needs without drowning the roots. Saturated \n",
      "soil drives out air, and roots can die from lack of oxygen. \n",
      "Proper pot drainage is critical. All the soil in a pot should \n",
      "be wetted thoroughly each time the plant is watered. \n",
      "Always empty the drainage water from the catch basin \n",
      "beneath your plant container after each watering. This \n",
      "will reduce the possibility of water-logged soil and \n",
      "prevent the dissolved salts in the water from being \n",
      "drawn back into the soil. Soil should dry to the point that \n",

      "Do not use water that is unusually high in salts or has \n",
      "been run through a water softener to water plants. Rain \n",
      "or melted snow are good alternate sources of water for \n",
      "houseplants. Some plants are sensitive to the chlorine \n",

      "no one-size-fits-all answer, as different plants have different water requirements. However, here \n",
      "are some general guidelines to help you determine the watering frequency for your houseplants:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Check the soil moisture: The best way to determine if a plant needs watering is to check \n",
      "the moisture level of the soil. Insert your finger about an inch into the soil near the \n",
      "plant's root zone. If the soil feels dry at that depth, it's usually time to water. If the soil \n",
      "still feels moist, you can wait a bit longer before watering. Be sure to check the soil at \n",
      "different depths to get a more accurate reading.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Plant species and water needs: Research the specific water requirements of each plant \n",

      "out slightly between waterings. Plants with thicker leaves or those adapted to arid \n",
      "conditions typically require less frequent watering than plants with thin leaves or those \n",
      "from tropical regions.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Potting mix and container: The type of potting mix and container can affect watering \n",
      "frequency. Well-draining potting mixes allow excess water to drain away, reducing the \n",
      "risk of overwatering and root rot. Containers with drainage holes help prevent water \n",
      "from accumulating at the bottom of the pot. Adjust the watering frequency based on the\n",
      "characteristics of your potting mix and container.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Environmental factors: Environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and air \n",
      "circulation can affect the rate at which plants dry out. Higher temperatures, low humidity,\n",
      "and increased airflow can lead to faster evaporation and may require more frequent \n",
      "watering. Conversely, cooler temperatures, higher humidity, and reduced airflow may \n",
      "result in slower soil drying and require less frequent watering.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Plant growth stage: Consider the growth stage of your plants. Young plants and those in \n",
      "active growth typically require more frequent watering compared to mature or dormant \n",
      "plants. Plants in flower or fruiting stages may also have higher water demands.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "Watering technique: When watering, ensure that you water thoroughly, allowing water to\n",

      "guidelines for the correct watering technique:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Choose the right watering container: Select a watering container that allows for easy and\n",
      "controlled pouring, such as a watering can with a narrow spout. This helps direct the \n",
      "water to the plant's base and prevents excessive splashing or runoff.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Water at the base of the plant: Direct the water toward the base of the plant, aiming to \n",
      "wet the soil directly around the root zone. This helps to ensure that the water reaches the\n",
      "roots where it's needed most. Avoid watering the foliage excessively, as it can lead to \n",
      "fungal diseases or leaf damage.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Water thoroughly: When you water, aim to moisten the entire root ball evenly. Keep \n",
      "watering until you see water starting to drain out of the pot's drainage holes. This \n",
      "ensures that the entire root system receives water and helps flush out any built-up salts \n",
      "or mineral deposits in the soil.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Allow excess water to drain: Allow any excess water to drain away completely after \n",
      "watering. Discard the water that collects in the saucer or tray beneath the pot to prevent \n",
      "waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Avoid frequent shallow watering: Instead of watering lightly and frequently, it's generally \n",
      "better to water deeply but less frequently. This encourages the plant's roots to grow \n",
      "deeper in search of water, promoting a stronger and more resilient root system.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "Consider the potting mix and drainage: Ensure that your potting mix is well-draining, \n",
      "allowing water to flow through easily. If the potting mix retains water excessively or \n",
      "becomes compacted, it may lead to waterlogged conditions. Choose containers with \n",
      "drainage holes to facilitate proper water drainage.\n",
      "7.\n",
      "Observe the plant's needs: Regularly monitor your plants for signs of watering needs. \n",

      "Caring for carnivorous plants at home can be a fascinating and rewarding experience. These \n",
      "unique plants have adapted to survive in nutrient-poor environments by obtaining nutrients \n",
      "from insects and other small prey. Here are some key things to know about caring for \n",
      "carnivorous plants:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Light Requirements:\n",
      "\n",
      "Most carnivorous plants require bright, indirect light to thrive. Place them near a \n",
      "window with filtered sunlight or provide supplemental artificial grow lights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid exposing them to intense, direct sunlight for prolonged periods, as it can \n",
      "cause leaf burn.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Watering:\n",
      "\n",
      "Carnivorous plants generally prefer to be kept consistently moist, but it's \n",
      "important not to waterlog their soil or growing medium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use distilled or rainwater for watering, as tap water often contains minerals that \n",
      "can harm the plants over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Water the plants from below by placing them in a tray or saucer filled with water. \n",
      "Keep the water level below the pot's drainage holes.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Growing Medium:\n",
      "\n",
      "Carnivorous plants require a specific growing medium that mimics their natural \n",
      "habitat. Most commonly, a mix of sphagnum moss and perlite is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid using regular potting soil or mixes containing fertilizers, as they can harm \n",
      "carnivorous plants.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Humidity:\n",
      "\n",
      "Carnivorous plants prefer higher humidity levels. You can increase humidity \n",
      "around the plants by placing them on trays with water and pebbles or using a \n",
      "humidifier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid misting the foliage directly, as it can wash away the sticky traps or cause \n",
      "fungal issues.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Feeding:\n",
      "\n",
      "Carnivorous plants obtain nutrients from capturing and digesting insects and \n",
      "other small prey. They can usually catch their own food when grown outdoors or \n",
      "near windows where insects are present.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your carnivorous plant is not catching enough prey naturally, you may \n",
      "supplement their diet with live or freeze-dried insects, such as fruit flies, crickets, \n",
      "or mealworms. Feed them sparingly to avoid overfeeding.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "Dormancy:\n",
      "\n",
      "Many carnivorous plants have a dormancy period during which they require a \n",
      "period of rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research the specific dormancy requirements of your carnivorous plant species. \n",
      "Some may require a cool, dry period, while others may simply have a reduced \n",
      "growth period.\n",
      "7.\n",
      "Pest Control:\n",
      "\n",
      "Carnivorous plants are generally resistant to common pests, but they can \n",
      "occasionally be affected by fungal or bacterial issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monitor the plants regularly for signs of pests or diseases, such as mold, rot, or \n",
      "discoloration. Treat any issues promptly with appropriate fungicides or \n",
      "bactericides formulated for use on carnivorous plants.\n",
      "8.\n",
      "Patience:\n",
      "\n",
      "Carnivorous plants can be slow-growing, and it may take time for them to \n",
      "establish and display their full carnivorous capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be patient and allow the plants to adapt to their new environment. With proper \n",
      "care, they will reward you with their unique and fascinating features.\n",
      "It's essential to research the specific care requirements of the carnivorous plant species you have,\n",
      "as different species may have slightly different needs. By providing the appropriate growing \n",
      "conditions and mimicking their natural environment, you can enjoy the beauty and captivating \n",
      "behavior of these extraordinary plants.\n",
      "Conclusion: Taking care of houseplants is a fulfilling and rewarding experience that brings \n",
      "nature into your home. By following the guidelines provided in this comprehensive guide, you \n",
      "will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to create a thriving indoor garden. Remember \n",
      "that every plant is unique and may require specific care, so observing and responding to their \n",
      "individual needs is essential. With patience, attention, and a little green thumb, you can enjoy \n",

      "First, realize that most of the foliage plants known as \n",
      "house plants are native to tropical areas. This is why, for \n",

      "guide for the selection and placement of your plants. \n",
      "See Tables 2-4. \n",
      "Plants vary considerably in their light requirements. For \n",
      "example, plants such as the croton need direct sunlight, \n",
      "while philodendrons will grow under lower light intensi­\n",

      "Never keep ordinary indoor plants standing in water \n",

      "water. Such fertilizer analyses as 20-20-20, 5-10-5, \n",
      "4-12-4, or 7-7-7 may be used. Apply once a month during \n",
      "the growing season. Often a grower will purchase a \n",
      "commercially prepared soluble fertilizer. He should then \n",
      "use it according to the directions on the container. \n",
      "Slow release fertilizers save time. Follow the label \n",
      "directions. Apply amounts (usually given in teaspoons or \n",
      "tablespoons) to the soil. Each time you water, some \n",
      "nutrients are released. A new application can be given \n",
      "when recommended on the label. If you have fertilized \n",
      "plants through the summer months, little or no fertilizer is \n",
      "necessary during the winter. Plants should be allowed to \n",
      "become dormant at this time and produce little growth. \n",
      "Soil Preparation \n",
      "Adequate water drainage is essential for plants growing \n",
      "in containers. Ensure good drainage by mixing soil with \n",
      "liberal amounts of sand or perlite. These materials help \n",
      "aerify the soil, improve root growth, and allow water to \n",
      "easily penetrate the mixture. \n",
      "A good soil mix includes two parts peat moss, one part \n",
      "sand, and one part perlite; or one part silt or clay loam \n",
      "garden soil, one part organic matter (peat moss), and \n",
      "one part coarse sand or perlite. Commercial potting soils \n",
      "can also be used. These usually require the addition of \n",
      "one part sand or perlite to improve drainage and plant \n",
      "growth. \n",
      "Sterilize the soil mix to remove weed, insect, and disease \n",
      "organisms. Place the soil mix in an oven and heat to \n",
      "180oF for 20-30 minutes. Tools and containers should \n",
      "also be sterilized. Wash equipment in a chlorine bleach-\n",
      "water solution (1:10 by volume) to kill disease organisms. \n",
      "Repotting \n",
      "In the spring when new growth starts, turn each of your \n",
      "plants upside down, tape the edge of the pot, and \n",
      "remove the plant. If the roots are in a solid mass, they \n",

      "In general, a plant needs an environ­\n",
      "ment as similar as possible to that in which \n",
      "it grows naturally. Understory plants (those \n",
      "that live on the forest floor) can grow in dif­\n",
      "fuse light. Plants from deserts or other open \n",
      "environments require strong light. Tropical \n",
      "and subtropical species generally do best \n",
      "in humid conditions, and desert species \n",
      "require arid conditions. Cool-climate spe­\n",
      "cies prefer cool nights and warm days, while \n",
      "tropical species prefer warm temperatures \n",
      "at all times. Learn about the specific plants \n",
      "you are growing (or plan to acquire) and \n",
      "place them in a location that provides the \n",
      "best combination of environmental factors \n",
      "for their needs. \n",
      "Cultivating houseplants is enjoyable and \n",
      "rewarding. The basic culture is not difficult, \n",
      "and most plants require only a few minutes \n",
      "of attention each week once their basic \n",
      "environmental requirements are satisfied. \n",
      "They do, however, require this minimal care \n",
      "on a regular basis. Plants are living things \n",
      "and must be managed so that their life-sup­\n",
      "port systems function properly at all times. \n",
      "The following sections discuss several \n",
      "important aspects of plant care. \n",
      "Light\n",
      "Perhaps the major environmental factor \n",
      "limiting plant growth indoors is lack of ade­\n",
      "quate light. As natural light enters homes, it \n",
      "decreases very quickly. For example, a plant \n",
      "1 foot away from a window may receive \n",
      "100 foot-candles of light. If it is moved 2 \n",
      "feet away from the window, it will receive \n",
      "only 25 foot-candles of light. At 3 feet it \n",
      "receives only 11 foot-candles, and very few, \n",
      "if any, houseplants do well at such low light \n",
      "intensities.\n",
      "The most expedient method of adjusting \n",
      "light intensity is to move the plant closer \n",
      "to or farther from a light source such as a \n",
      "window. Unfortunately, this may place the \n",
      "plant in an inconvenient spot. \n",
      "To increase light intensity you can:\n",
      "•\t Moving the plant to a lighter room \n",
      "(southern versus northern exposure)\n",
      "•\t Placing the plant near an electric light\n",
      "•\t Providing separate artificial light for the \n",

      "several disease problems.\n",
      "Major Pests\n",
      "Aphids\n",
      "Aphids are small insects about 1⁄16 to 1⁄8 \n",
      "inch long. They are six-legged, variously \n",
      "colored, and some look powdery or woolly. \n",
      "Both wingless and winged forms can be \n",
      "found on plants. Under the right conditions, \n",
      "aphids multiply rapidly and can spread \n",

      "lose their green color and look stunted, \n",
      "distorted, or curled. Heavy infestations may \n",
      "damage or actually kill plants. \n",
      "The excreta (honeydew) given off by \n",
      "aphids is another problem associated with \n",
      "this pest. This material is sticky, gives leaf \n",
      "surfaces a shiny look, and provides food for \n",
      "the development of sooty mold.\n",
      "Whiteflies\n",
      "Whiteflies are tiny insects about 1⁄10 to 1⁄16 \n",
      "inch long that resemble tiny moths. Their \n",
      "bodies and wings are covered with a white, \n",

      "hold their wings rooflike over their bodies. \n",
      "Both the immature stages and adults have \n",

      "stages in the whitefly’s development: \n",
      "1.\t The egg, which is laid on the underside of \n",
      "a leaf and often is covered with a pow­\n",
      "dery material\n",
      "2.\t The newly hatched or “crawler” nymph, \n",
      "which is flat, nearly transparent, and can \n",

      "3.\t The intermediate nymph, which has no \n",

      "hold nuisance.\n",
      "Scales\n",
      "Several different scales infest house­\n",
      "plants. The adults generally are quite small, \n",
      "ranging from 1⁄16 to 1⁄8 inch in diameter, and \n",
      "may be white, black, brown, gray, or tan. \n",
      "They attach rigidly to plants. Many scales \n",
      "are shaped somewhat like a ball and have \n",

      "shapes, such as oyster shells (that is, oys­\n",

      "male is the only winged member of the \n",
      "scale group. \n",
      "Damage by scales is similar to that from \n",
      "aphids and whiteflies. Honeydew and sooty \n",
      "mold often are present. Severe plant injury \n",
      "or death may be the final result of poor \n",
      "control.\n",
      "Chemical control of adults often is \n",
      "impossible. The female usually lays eggs \n",
      "under a scale. When eggs hatch, tiny \n",
      "crawlers emerge and begin to move about \n",
      "in search of a place to feed. The crawler \n",
